title: Data and knowledge strategies
---

<br/>

Organisations need a data strategy to ensure the data they collect informs the critical decisions they make. A data strategy not only describes the way data 
will be stored and safeguarded but also how analyses and their outcomes will be recorded, evaluated, and disseminated. 

However, a great amount of institutional knowledge lies outside the digital realm, acquired over decades or even generations of practice and experience. The value of such knowledge usually only becomes evident during periods of staff turnover when experienced staff leave. Consequently, it is advisable for organisations to develop a knowledge strategy to ensure institutional knowledge, which cannot easily be captured in data, is not lost.

- *A data strategy is a mechanism to coordinate and govern the flow of information from data collection to organisational decision making*
- *A knowledge strategy is a mechanism to safeguard institutional knowledge which cannot be stored as data*
