<br/>

Surprisingly few organisations invest in training their staff in understanding the purpose and principles of data collection, its analysis, and interpretation. As a consequence:
- *Field staff are often disengaged with data and its meaning* 
- *Staff are not equipped to analyse and evaluate the data*
- *Managers fail to base their decisions on the evidence*
- *Organisations persist with ineffectual activities, work programs, and strategies while abandoning effective ones*

### R for reproducibility

We are shameless advocates of Program R, a free statistical programming environment and offer training in it. We enthusiastically recommend:
- *[R for Conservation and Development Projects](https://nathanwhitmore.github.io/R4condevblog/) as a useful introductory text*
- *[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) as a free, integrated development environment*
- *[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) for the production of organisational dashboards*<br/>
